# Mahabharata Family Tree

I have tried to create a relatively simple graph which I intend to use in future projects where I work on graphs. I cannot guarantee the accuracy or the completeness of the family tree. The data used has been taken from [[1]]

[[1]]Srimadbhagavatam.org. (n.d.). Family tree extended: from Purûravâ up to Krishna and from Kuru up to the Pândavas. Retrieved from https://srimadbhagavatam.org
